# PMI analysis

Recent research suggests that the PMI - post-mortem interval, is a critical feature that must be taken into account when
sequencing mRNA.

we are asking if the same is true for tRF - tRNA fragments, that prior research has shown to be involved in 
protein manufacturing regulation in the cell. 

In this analysis, we looked at a dataset of patients with different Altimeters conditions (AD), and asked will the tRFs 
count be correlated with the PMI of
